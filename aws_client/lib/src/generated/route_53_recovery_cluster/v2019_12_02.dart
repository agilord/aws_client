/// Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for
/// Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.
///
/// With Route 53 ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to
/// recover applications by rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or
/// Amazon Web Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches
/// hosted on a highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a
/// set of five redundant Regional endpoints against which you can run API calls
/// to get or update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you
/// set one routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic
/// from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another.
///
/// <i>Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you
/// work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in
/// Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region
/// for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter <code>--region
/// us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more information, see <a
/// href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
/// Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route
/// 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
///
/// This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get
/// and update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing
/// control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components
