/// (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based
/// events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from
/// CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also
/// extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.
///
/// The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior
/// graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member
/// accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.
///
/// To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account
/// sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation,
/// it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.
///
/// Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization management
/// account designates the Detective administrator account for the organization.
/// That account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior
/// graph. The Detective administrator account is also the delegated
/// administrator account for Detective in Organizations.
///
/// The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account as a
/// member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization accounts
/// do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account can also
/// invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.
///
/// Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to
/// manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the
/// currently selected endpoint.
///
/// The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API to
/// do the following:
///
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior
/// graph.
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// Apply tags to a behavior graph.
/// </li>
/// </ul>
/// The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the
/// delegated administrator for Detective.
///
/// The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the
/// Detective API to do the following:
///
/// <ul>
/// <li>
/// Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.
/// </li>
/// <li>
/// Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as
/// member accounts in the organization behavior graph.
