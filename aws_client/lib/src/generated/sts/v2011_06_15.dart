  ///
  /// To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services
  /// account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in

  ///
  /// A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
  /// permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The
  /// administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call

  ///
  /// To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of

  /// Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same

  /// <note>
  /// Although it is possible to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> using the
