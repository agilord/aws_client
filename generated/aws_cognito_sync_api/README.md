# AWS API client for Amazon Cognito Sync

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable
cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client
libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these
libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if the device
is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile
device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a
normalized user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that
can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets
per user identity.
