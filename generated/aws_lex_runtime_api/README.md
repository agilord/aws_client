# AWS API client for Amazon Lex Runtime Service

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides
a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the runtime API to
understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose
a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using
the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is for the
OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex
engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required
information (slot values, such as pizza size and crust type), and then
performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the
bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot.
For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API, .
