# AWS API client for Amazon Elastic  Inference

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Elastic Inference public APIs.

February 15, 2023: Starting April 15, 2023, AWS will not onboard new
customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers
migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and performance.
After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to launch instances
with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2.
However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least once during the past
30-day period are considered current customers and will be able to continue
using the service.
