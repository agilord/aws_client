# AWS API client for AWS Directory Service

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and
run directories in the Amazon Web Services cloud, or connect your Amazon Web
Services resources with an existing self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.
This guide provides detailed information about Directory Service operations,
data types, parameters, and errors. For information about Directory Services
features, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">Directory
Service</a> and the <a

Service Administration Guide</a>.
<note>
Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code
for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS,
Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
access to Directory Service and other Amazon Web Services services. For more
information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download
