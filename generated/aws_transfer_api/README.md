# AWS API client for AWS Transfer Family

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of
files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL
(FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into
and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you
seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer Family by
integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing
with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or
their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS
services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting
started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to
buy and set up.
