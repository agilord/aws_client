# AWS API client for Amazon OpenSearch Service

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Use the Amazon OpenSearch Service configuration API to create, configure,
and manage OpenSearch Service domains.

For sample code that uses the configuration API, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/opensearch-configuration-samples.html">
<i>Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide</i> </a>. The guide also
contains <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/request-signing.html">sample
code</a> for sending signed HTTP requests to the OpenSearch APIs. The
endpoint for configuration service requests is Region specific:
es.<i>region</i>.amazonaws.com. For example, es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For
a current list of supported Regions and endpoints, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#service-regions">Amazon
