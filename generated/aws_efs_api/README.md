# AWS API client for Amazon Elastic File System

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file
storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EFS,
storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add
and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they
need it. For more information, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
Guide</a>.
