# AWS API client for Amazon Elastic File System

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file
storage for use with Amazon EC2 Linux and Mac instances in the Amazon Web
Services Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and
shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so that your
applications have the storage they need, when they need it. For more
information, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html">Amazon
Elastic File System API Reference</a> and the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html">Amazon
Elastic File System User Guide</a>.
