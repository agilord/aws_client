# AWS API client for AWS Cloud Map

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
AWS Cloud Map lets you configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP namespaces
that your microservice applications run in. When an instance of the service
becomes available, you can call the AWS Cloud Map API to register the
instance with AWS Cloud Map. For public or private DNS namespaces, AWS Cloud
Map automatically creates DNS records and an optional health check. Clients
that submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP requests, for the service
receive an answer that contains up to eight healthy records.
