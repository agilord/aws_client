# AWS API client for AWS Cloud Map

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
With Cloud Map, you can configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP
namespaces that your microservice applications run in. When an instance
becomes available, you can call the Cloud Map API to register the instance
with Cloud Map. For public or private DNS namespaces, Cloud Map
automatically creates DNS records and an optional health check. Clients that
submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP requests, for the service
receive an answer that contains up to eight healthy records.
