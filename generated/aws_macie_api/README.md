# AWS API client for Amazon Macie

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Macie Classic is a security service that uses machine learning to
automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie
Classic recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable
information (PII) or intellectual property, and provides you with dashboards
and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being accessed or
moved. For more information, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/what-is-macie.html">Amazon
Macie Classic User Guide</a>.
