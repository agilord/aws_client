*About the service:*
Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service
that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly
connected datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built,
high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of
relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Amazon
Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and
their respective query languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL,
allowing you to easily build queries that efficiently navigate highly
connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation
engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network
security.
