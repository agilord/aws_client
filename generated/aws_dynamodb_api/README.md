*About the service:*
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast

offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed
database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup
and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.
