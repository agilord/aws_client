*About the service:*
This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API
operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a service that uses program analysis and
machine learning to detect potential defects that are difficult for
developers to find and recommends fixes in your Java and Python code.

By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing code
defects and implementing best practices, CodeGuru Reviewer improves the
overall quality and maintainability of your code base during the code review
stage. For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the <i> <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html">Amazon
CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide</a>.</i>

To improve the security of your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can
establish a private connection between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by
creating an <i>interface VPC endpoint</i>. For more information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/vpc-interface-endpoints.html">CodeGuru
Reviewer and interface VPC endpoints (Amazon Web Services PrivateLink)</a>
in the <i>Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide</i>.
