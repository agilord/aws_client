# AWS API client for AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote
operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices connected to
AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices
to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate
certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations.

To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the
remote operations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets that
should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing
groups or both.

AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available.
The target starts the execution of the job by downloading the job document,
performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS
IoT. The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a
specific target and for all the targets of the job
