# AWS API client for AWS Marketplace Catalog Service

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Catalog API actions allow you to manage your entities through list,
describe, and update capabilities. An entity can be a product or an offer on
AWS Marketplace.

You can automate your entity update process by integrating the AWS
Marketplace Catalog API with your AWS Marketplace product build or
deployment pipelines. You can also create your own applications on top of
the Catalog API to manage your products on AWS Marketplace.
