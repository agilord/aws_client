# AWS API client for AWS RDS DataService

*About the service:*
Amazon RDS provides an HTTP endpoint to run SQL statements on an Amazon
Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. To run these statements, you work with the
Data Service API.
<note>
The Data Service API isn't supported on Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 DB
clusters.
