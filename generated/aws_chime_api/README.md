# AWS API client for Amazon Chime

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
The Amazon Chime application programming interface (API) is designed so
administrators can perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon
Chime accounts, users, and Voice Connectors. This guide provides detailed
information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs
and outputs, and error codes.

You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the
REST API to make API calls for Amazon Chime. We recommend using an AWS SDK
or the AWS CLI. The page for each API action contains a <i>See Also</i>
section that includes links to information about using the action with a
language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
<dl> <dt>Using an AWS SDK</dt> <dd>
You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request
authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access
keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/">AWS Developer Center</a>.
</dd> <dt>Using the AWS CLI</dt> <dd>
Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information
about setting up the AWS CLI, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">Installing
the AWS Command Line Interface</a> in the <i>AWS Command Line Interface User
Guide</i>. For a list of available Amazon Chime commands, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html">Amazon
Chime commands</a> in the <i>AWS CLI Command Reference</i>.
</dd> <dt>Using REST APIs</dt> <dd>
If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by
providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports Signature Version 4. For more
information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
Version 4 Signing Process</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General
Reference</i>.

When making REST API calls, use the service name <code>chime</code> and REST
endpoint <code>https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com</code>.
</dd> </dl>
Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM). For more information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/security-iam.html">Identity
and Access Management for Amazon Chime</a> in the <i>Amazon Chime
Administration Guide</i>.
