# AWS API client for Amazon Chime

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
The Amazon Chime API (application programming interface) is designed for
developers to perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon Chime
accounts, users, and Voice Connectors. This guide provides detailed
information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs
and outputs, and error codes. It also includes some server-side API actions
to use with the Amazon Chime SDK. For more information about the Amazon
Chime SDK, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meetings-sdk.html">Using
the Amazon Chime SDK</a> in the <i>Amazon Chime Developer Guide</i>.

You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the
REST API to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
Each API operation includes links to information about using it with a
language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
<dl> <dt>Using an AWS SDK</dt> <dd>
You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request
authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access
keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/">AWS Developer Center</a>.
</dd> <dt>Using the AWS CLI</dt> <dd>
Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information
about setting up the AWS CLI, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">Installing
the AWS Command Line Interface</a> in the <i>AWS Command Line Interface User
Guide</i>. For a list of available Amazon Chime commands, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html">Amazon
Chime commands</a> in the <i>AWS CLI Command Reference</i>.
</dd> <dt>Using REST</dt> <dd>
If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by
providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports Signature Version 4. For more
information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
Version 4 Signing Process</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General
Reference</i>.

When making REST API calls, use the service name <code>chime</code> and REST
endpoint <code>https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com</code>.
</dd> </dl>
Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM). For more information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/security-iam.html">Identity
and Access Management for Amazon Chime</a> in the <i>Amazon Chime
Administration Guide</i>.
