<b>API Summary</b>

The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of actions:

<ul>
<li>
Register and manage scalable targets - Register AWS or custom resources as
scalable targets (a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale), set
minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve information on existing
scalable targets.
</li>
<li>
Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies to
dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms, schedule
one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling
activity history.
</li>
<li>
Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic
scaling by calling the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_RegisterScalableTarget.html">RegisterScalableTarget</a>
API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend
and resume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities that are
triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered by a
scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.
</li>
</ul>
