# AWS API client for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that
makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up
or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source
system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of
containerized applications.

Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software,
so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes
community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with
applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running
in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily
migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code
modification required.
