# AWS API client for AWS MediaTailor

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor SDK to configure scalable ad insertion for
your live and VOD content. With AWS Elemental MediaTailor, you can serve
targeted ads to viewers while maintaining broadcast quality in over-the-top
(OTT) video applications. For information about using the service, including
detailed information about the settings covered in this guide, see the AWS
Elemental MediaTailor User Guide.
Through the SDK, you manage AWS Elemental MediaTailor configurations the
same as you do through the console. For example, you specify ad insertion
behavior and mapping information for the origin server and the ad decision
server (ADS).
