# AWS API client for AWS MediaTailor

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor SDKs and CLI to configure scalable ad
insertion and linear channels. With MediaTailor, you can assemble existing
content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while
maintaining broadcast quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications. For
information about using the service, including detailed information about
the settings covered in this guide, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/">AWS Elemental
MediaTailor User Guide</a>.

Through the SDKs and the CLI you manage AWS Elemental MediaTailor
configurations and channels the same as you do through the console. For
example, you specify ad insertion behavior and mapping information for the
origin server and the ad decision server (ADS).
