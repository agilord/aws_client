# AWS API client for AWS Compute Optimizer

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
utilization metrics of your AWS compute resources, such as EC2 instances,
Auto Scaling groups, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon EBS volumes. It
reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization
recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your
workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data,
as well as projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which
you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best
price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help
you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet
your performance and capacity requirements. For more information about
Compute Optimizer, including the required permissions to use the service,
see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/">AWS Compute
Optimizer User Guide</a>.
