# AWS API client for AWS Compute Optimizer

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
utilization metrics of your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances and Auto
Scaling groups. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates
optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance
of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric
data, as well as projected utilization metric data for the recommendations,
which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best
price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help
you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet
your performance and capacity requirements. For more information about
Compute Optimizer, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/">AWS Compute
Optimizer User Guide</a>.
