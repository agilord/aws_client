**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Alexa for Business helps you use Alexa in your organization. Alexa for
Business provides you with the tools to manage Alexa devices, enroll your
users, and assign skills, at scale. You can build your own context-aware
voice skills using the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa for Business API
operations. You can also make these available as private skills for your
organization. Alexa for Business makes it efficient to voice-enable your
products and services, thus providing context-aware voice experiences for
your customers. Device makers building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS)
can create fully integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa
for Business, and manage them as shared devices in their organization.
