# AWS API client for AWS CodeBuild

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild
compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are
ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and
scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for
the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache
Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in
AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales
automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time
you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the <i> <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS
CodeBuild User Guide</a>.</i>
