# AWS API client for AWS CodeBuild

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles
your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to
deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your
own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most
popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle,
and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild to
use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build
requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information
about CodeBuild, see the <i> <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodeBuild
User Guide</a>.</i>
