# AWS API client for AWS Resource Groups

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as Amazon EC2
instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, and Amazon S3
buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group
is a collection of resources that match the resource types specified in a
query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a
group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure,
lifecycle stages, regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria.
Resource Groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in
AWS Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS
Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you quickly view a
custom console in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and
other monitoring data about member resources.
