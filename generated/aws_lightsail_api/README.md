# AWS API client for Amazon Lightsail

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers
who just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you
need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, a managed database,
SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP - for a
low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail servers through the
Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface (CLI).

For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a
href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all">Lightsail Dev Guide</a>.

To use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM) to generate access keys. For details about how to
set this up, see the <a
href="http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli">Lightsail
Dev Guide</a>.
