# AWS API client for Amazon Lightsail

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services
(Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or web
applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly
- instances (virtual private servers), container services, storage buckets,
managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load
balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of
registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low,
predictable monthly price.

You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console,
Lightsail API, Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDKs. For more information
