# AWS API client for AWS Health APIs and Notifications

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health
information that appears in the <a
href="https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/">AWS Personal Health
Dashboard</a>. You can use the API operations to get information about AWS
Health events that affect your AWS services and resources.
<note>
You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a> to use the AWS
Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that doesn't
have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you receive a
<code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.
</note>
AWS Health has a single endpoint: health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS).
Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health API operations.
