# AWS API client for AWS Single Sign-On Admin

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you securely
create, or connect, your workforce identities and manage their access
centrally across AWS accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the
recommended approach for workforce authentication and authorization in AWS,
for organizations of any size and type.
<note>
Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and
<code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their
original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see
<a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM
Identity Center rename</a>.
</note>
This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which
could be used for access management of AWS accounts. For information about
IAM Identity Center features, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM
Identity Center User Guide</a>.

Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for
users and groups, known as principals. For more information about how to
work with principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html">Identity
Store API Reference</a>.
<note>
AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and
more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
IAM Identity Center and other AWS services. For more information about the
AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.
