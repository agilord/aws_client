# AWS API client for AWS Single Sign-On Admin

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
IAM Identity Center (successor to Single Sign-On) helps you securely create,
or connect, your workforce identities and manage their access centrally
across Amazon Web Services accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is
the recommended approach for workforce authentication and authorization in
Amazon Web Services, for organizations of any size and type.
<note>
IAM Identity Center uses the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code>
API namespaces.
</note>
This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which
could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For
information about IAM Identity Center features, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM
Identity Center User Guide</a>.

Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for
users and groups, known as principals. For more information about how to
work with principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html">Identity
Store API Reference</a>.
<note>
Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code
for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS,
Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
access to IAM Identity Center and other Amazon Web Services services. For
more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to
download and install them, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools
for Amazon Web Services</a>.
