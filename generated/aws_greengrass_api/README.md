# AWS API client for AWS Greengrass

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS onto physical devices so they can
act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for
management, analytics, and durable storage. AWS IoT Greengrass ensures your
devices can respond quickly to local events and operate with intermittent
connectivity. AWS IoT Greengrass minimizes the cost of transmitting data to
the cloud by allowing you to author AWS Lambda functions that execute
locally.
