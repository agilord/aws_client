# AWS API client for AWS SSO OIDC

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables
a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register with AWS SSO.
The service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon
successful authentication and authorization with AWS SSO. This service
conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based implementation of the device authorization
grant standard (<a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>).

For general information about AWS SSO, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What
is AWS Single Sign-On?</a> in the <i>AWS SSO User Guide</i>.

This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO OIDC operations that you can
call programatically and includes detailed information on data types and
errors.
<note>
AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, and
Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs,
including how to download and install them, see <a
