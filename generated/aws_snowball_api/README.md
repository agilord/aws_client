# AWS API client for Amazon Import/Export Snowball

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
The Amazon Web Services Snow Family provides a petabyte-scale data transport
solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data between
your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
The Snow Family commands described here provide access to the same
functionality that is available in the Amazon Web Services Snow Family
Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow
Family device. To transfer data locally with a Snow Family device, you'll
need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for
Snowball or OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
Guide</a>.
