# AWS API client for Amazon Import/Export Snowball

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS Snow Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data
centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow commands
described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in
the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to create and
manage jobs for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device,
you'll need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface
for Snowball or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
Guide</a>.
