# AWS API client for Amazon Import/Export Snowball

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data
centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands
described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in
the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables you to create and manage
jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball device, you'll
need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball.

Guide</a>.
