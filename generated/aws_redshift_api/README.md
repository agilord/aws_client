# AWS API client for Amazon Redshift

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains
documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can
use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is
asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such
as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command
has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate
whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or
during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift
cluster management interfaces, go to <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html">Using
the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces</a>.
