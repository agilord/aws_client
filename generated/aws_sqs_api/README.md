# AWS API client for Amazon Simple Queue Service

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Welcome to the <i>Amazon SQS API Reference</i>.

Amazon SQS is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages
as they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS moves data
between distributed application components and helps you decouple these
components.

For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-authentication-and-access-control.html">Identity
and access management</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide.</i>

You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk">Amazon Web Services
SDKs</a> to access Amazon SQS using your favorite programming language. The
SDKs perform tasks such as the following automatically:

<ul>
<li>
Cryptographically sign your service requests
</li>
<li>
Retry requests
</li>
<li>
Handle error responses
</li>
</ul>
