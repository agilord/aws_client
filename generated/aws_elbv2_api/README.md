# AWS API client for Elastic Load Balancing

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your
EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your
application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered
targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You
configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or
more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for
connections from clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group
with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to
the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the
health status of the targets.
