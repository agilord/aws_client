# AWS API client for AWS WAFV2

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
This is the latest version of the <b>WAF</b> API, released in November,
2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like
endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like
"V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating
your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant
improvements.
