# AWS API client for Service Quotas

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Service Quotas is a web service that you can use to manage many of your AWS
service quotas. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum values
for a resource, item, or operation. This guide provide descriptions of the
Service Quotas actions that you can call from an API. For the Service Quotas
user guide, which explains how to use Service Quotas from the console, see
<a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html">What
is Service Quotas</a>.
<note>
AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for programming
languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc...,). The SDKs
provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Service Quotas and
AWS. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
install them, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws.amazon.com/tools">Tools for Amazon Web
Services</a> page.
