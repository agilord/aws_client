# AWS API client for AWS Signer

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
With code signing for IoT, you can sign code that you create for any IoT
device that is supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Code signing is
available through <a
href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon
FreeRTOS</a> and <a
href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT Device
Management</a>, and integrated with <a
href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate
Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you import a third-party code
signing certificate with ACM that is used to sign updates in Amazon FreeRTOS
and AWS IoT Device Management. For general information about using code
signing, see the <a
href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">Code
Signing for IoT Developer Guide</a>.
