# AWS API client for AmazonApiGatewayManagementApi

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
The Amazon API Gateway Management API allows you to directly manage runtime
aspects of your deployed APIs. To use it, you must explicitly set the SDK's
endpoint to point to the endpoint of your deployed API. The endpoint will be
of the form https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}, or
will be the endpoint corresponding to your API's custom domain and base
path, if applicable.
