# AWS API client for AWS Direct Connect

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Direct Connect links your internal network to an Direct Connect location
over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is
connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router. With this
connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the
Amazon Web Services Cloud (for example, to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3) and to
Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. A
connection provides access to all Amazon Web Services Regions except the
China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions. Amazon Web Services resources
in the China Regions can only be accessed through locations associated with
those Regions.
