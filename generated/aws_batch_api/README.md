**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Using AWS Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud.
Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers
to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch utilizes the
advantages of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy
lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure, while also
adopting a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these
advantages, AWS Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in
response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping to eliminate capacity
constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.

As a fully managed service, AWS Batch can run batch computing workloads of
any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and
optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your
specific workloads. With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage
batch computing software. This means that you can focus your time and energy
on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.
