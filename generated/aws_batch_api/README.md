# AWS API client for AWS Batch

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud.
Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to
access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the
undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required
infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to users of traditional batch
computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in
response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints,
reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.

As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and
engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch
automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload
distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS
Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software, which
allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch
reduces operational complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes
it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in
the AWS Cloud.
