# AWS API client for AWS Batch

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web
Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers,
scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources.
Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to remove the
undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing
software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision resources, and
work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing your overall compute
costs, and delivering results more quickly.
