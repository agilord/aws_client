Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set
up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer
engagement at any scale.

Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to
optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more
efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents.

There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can
create. There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make
per second. For more information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html">Amazon
Connect Service Quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</i>.

You can connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service by using
