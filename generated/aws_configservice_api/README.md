# AWS API client for AWS Config

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the Amazon
Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account. You
can use Config to get the current and historical configurations of each
Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the
relationship between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be
an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS)
volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a
complete list of resources currently supported by Config, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported
Amazon Web Services resources</a>.
