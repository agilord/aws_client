# AWS API client for AWS Config

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the AWS
resources associated with your AWS account. You can use AWS Config to get
the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also to
get information about the relationship between the resources. An AWS
resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic
Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security
group. For a complete list of resources currently supported by AWS Config,
see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources">Supported
AWS Resources</a>.
