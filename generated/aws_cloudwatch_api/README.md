# AWS API client for Amazon CloudWatch

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the
applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect
and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your
resources and applications.

CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources
you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can
monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2
instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch
additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to
stop under-used instances to save money.

In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can
monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide
visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
operational health.
