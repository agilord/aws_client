# AWS API client for Amazon CloudWatch

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services)
resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in real time.
You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables
you want to measure for your resources and applications.

CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources
you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can
monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2
instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch
additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to
stop under-used instances to save money.

In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web
Services, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain
system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance,
and operational health.
