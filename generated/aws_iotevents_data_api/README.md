# AWS API client for AWS IoT Events Data

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
IoT Events monitors your equipment or device fleets for failures or changes
in operation, and triggers actions when such events occur. You can use IoT
Events Data API commands to send inputs to detectors, list detectors, and
view or update a detector's status.
