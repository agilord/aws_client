# AWS API client for AWS Import/Export

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
transferring large amounts of data between the AWS cloud and portable
storage devices that you mail to us. AWS Import/Export transfers data
directly onto and off of your storage devices using Amazon's high-speed
internal network and bypassing the Internet. For large data sets, AWS
Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective
than upgrading your connectivity.
