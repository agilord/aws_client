# AWS API client for Amazon CodeGuru Profiler

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API
operations.

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data from your live
applications, and provides recommendations that can help you fine-tune your
application performance. Using machine learning algorithms, CodeGuru
Profiler can help you find your most expensive lines of code and suggest
ways you can improve efficiency and remove CPU bottlenecks.

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling data
to help you identify what code is running on the CPU, see how much time is
consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.
<note>
Amazon CodeGuru Profiler currently supports applications written in all Java
virtual machine (JVM) languages and Python. While CodeGuru Profiler supports
both visualizations and recommendations for applications written in Java, it
can also generate visualizations and a subset of recommendations for
applications written in other JVM languages and Python.
