# AWS API client for Amazon CodeGuru Profiler

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API
operations.
<pre><code> &lt;p&gt;Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance
data from your live applications, and provides recommendations that can help
you fine-tune your application performance. Using machine learning
algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler can help you find your most expensive lines of
code and suggest ways you can improve efficiency and remove CPU bottlenecks.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different
visualizations of profiling data to help you identify what code is running
on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU
utilization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amazon CodeGuru Profiler
currently supports applications written in all Java virtual machine (JVM)
languages. While CodeGuru Profiler supports both visualizations and
recommendations for applications written in Java, it can also generate
visualizations and a subset of recommendations for applications written in
other JVM languages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;p&gt; For more information,
see &lt;a

is Amazon CodeGuru Profiler&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Amazon CodeGuru
Profiler User Guide&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>
