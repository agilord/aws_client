# AWS API client for AWS Lambda

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or
managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute
infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute
resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity
provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With
Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend
service. For more information about the Lambda service, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What is
Lambda</a> in the <b>Lambda Developer Guide</b>.
