# AWS API client for Amazon GuardDuty

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes
and processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail
event logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists
of malicious IPs and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected
and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS
environment. This can include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of
exposed credentials, or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains.
For example, GuardDuty can detect compromised EC2 instances serving malware
or mining bitcoin. It also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of
compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments, like instances
deployed in a region that has never been used, or unusual API calls, like a
password policy change to reduce password strength. GuardDuty informs you of
the status of your AWS environment by producing security findings that you
can view in the GuardDuty console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For
more information, see <a

GuardDuty User Guide</a>.
