# AWS API client for AWS Resource Access Manager

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
This is the <i>Resource Access Manager API Reference</i>. This documentation
provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in
RAM. RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services
resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If you use Organizations to
manage your accounts, then you can share your resources with your entire
organization or to organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types,
you can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management
(IAM) roles and users.
