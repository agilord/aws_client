# AWS API client for AWS Migration Hub

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application
migration status and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by
providing a programmatic interface to Migration Hub.

Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you
call any of these APIs, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error
will be returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home
region.
