# AWS API client for AWS IoT

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected
devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances)
and the Amazon Web Services cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data
endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and
integration with other services, organize resources associated with each
device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and
credentials to authenticate devices.
