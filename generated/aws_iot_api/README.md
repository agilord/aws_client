# AWS API client for AWS IoT

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between
Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or
smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data
endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data processing and
integration with other services, organize resources associated with each
device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and
credentials to authenticate devices.
