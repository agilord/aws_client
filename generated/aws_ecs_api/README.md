# AWS API client for Amazon EC2 Container Service

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless
infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or
tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host your
tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. For more information about
launch types, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html">Amazon
ECS Launch Types</a>.
