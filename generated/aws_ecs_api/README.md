# AWS API client for Amazon EC2 Container Service

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
container management service. It makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
Docker containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure
that's managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate.
For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances that you
manage.
