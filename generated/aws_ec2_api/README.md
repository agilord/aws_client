# AWS API client for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable
computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Using Amazon EC2
eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and
deploy applications faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web
Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a
virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes
are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to
any running instance and used like a hard drive.
