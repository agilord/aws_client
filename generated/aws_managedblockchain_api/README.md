# AWS API client for Amazon Managed Blockchain

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
<p/>
Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and
managing blockchain networks using open-source frameworks. Blockchain allows
you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and
transparently run transactions and share data without the need for a
trusted, central authority.

Managed Blockchain supports the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum open-source
frameworks. Because of fundamental differences between the frameworks, some
API actions or data types may only apply in the context of one framework and
not the other. For example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network
members such as <code>CreateMember</code> and <code>DeleteMember</code>
don't apply to Ethereum.

The description for each action indicates the framework or frameworks to
which it applies. Data types and properties that apply only in the context
of a particular framework are similarly indicated.
