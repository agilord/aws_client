*About the service:*
AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access risks by
enabling you to identify any policies that grant access to an external
principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze
resource-based policies in your AWS environment. An external principal can
be another AWS account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user,
an AWS service, or an anonymous user. This guide describes the AWS IAM
Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically. For general
information about Access Analyzer, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">AWS
IAM Access Analyzer section of the IAM User Guide</a>.

To start using Access Analyzer, you first need to create an analyzer.
