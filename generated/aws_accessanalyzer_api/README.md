# AWS API client for Access Analyzer

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps identify potential
resource-access risks by enabling you to identify any policies that grant
access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning
to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment.
An external principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root
user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service,
or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview and
validate public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying
permissions changes. This guide describes the Identity and Access Management
Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically. For general
information about IAM Access Analyzer, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">Identity
and Access Management Access Analyzer</a> in the <b>IAM User Guide</b>.

To start using IAM Access Analyzer, you first need to create an analyzer.
