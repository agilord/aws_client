# AWS API client for Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX
dramatically speeds up database reads by caching frequently-accessed data
from DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-millisecond
latency. You can create a DAX cluster easily, using the AWS Management
Console. With a few simple modifications to your code, your application can
begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster and realize significant
improvements in read performance.
