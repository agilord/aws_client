*About the service:*
AWS IoT-Data enables secure, bi-directional communication between
Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or

and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and
delete shadows. A shadow is a persistent representation of your things and
their state in the AWS cloud.
