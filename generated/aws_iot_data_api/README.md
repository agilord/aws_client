# AWS API client for AWS IoT Data Plane

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
IoT data enables secure, bi-directional communication between
Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or
smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. It implements a broker
for applications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and
retrieve, update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a persistent
representation of your things and their state in the Amazon Web Services
cloud.
