  /// matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different
  /// game scenarios. All matchmaking requests identify the matchmaking

  /// configuration.
  ///
  /// To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following:
  /// configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without Amazon GameLift
  /// hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find
  /// acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum

  /// GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use
  /// when starting a game session for the match.
  ///
  /// In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service topic
  /// to receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the topic ARN in the

  /// Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used
  /// to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand.
  /// An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric
  /// and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is
  /// reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and
  /// rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage
  /// fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based
  /// policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.
  ///
  /// Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the
  /// same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple
  /// rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however,
  /// because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.
  ///
  /// Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a
  /// href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set
  /// Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.
  ///
  /// <b>Target-based policy</b>
  ///
  /// A target-based policy tracks a single metric:
  /// PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's
  /// hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in
  /// use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand
  /// that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based
  /// policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to
  /// take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.
  ///
  /// For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that
  /// has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells
  /// Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity
  /// falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start
  /// new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10%
  /// buffer.
  ///
  /// To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name,
  /// and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track
  /// (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a
  /// <code>TargetConfiguration</code> object with your desired buffer value.
  /// Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is
  /// returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's
  /// successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily
  /// suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are
  /// restarted.
  ///
  /// <b>Rule-based policy</b>
  ///
  /// A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value,
  /// and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a
  /// rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics.
  /// Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much),
  /// so you need one policy for each type of action.
  ///
  /// For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage
  /// of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then
  /// reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."
  ///
  /// A policy's rule statement has the following structure:
  ///
  /// If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code>
  /// <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes,
  /// then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by
  /// <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.
  ///
  /// To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:
  ///
  /// If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is
  /// <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for
  /// <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code>
  /// to/by <code>[10]</code>.
  ///
  /// To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name
  /// and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the
  /// parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the
  /// policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as
  /// soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions
  /// are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet
