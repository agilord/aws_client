# AWS API client for AWS Savings Plans

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on AWS
usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a consistent
amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and receive a
lower price for that usage. For more information, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/">AWS
Savings Plans User Guide</a>.
