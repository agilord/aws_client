# AWS API client for AWS Savings Plans

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on Amazon
Web Services usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a
consistent amount of usage per hour, in the specified currency, for a term
of one or three years, and receive a lower price for that usage. For more
information, see the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/">Amazon Web
Services Savings Plans User Guide</a>.
