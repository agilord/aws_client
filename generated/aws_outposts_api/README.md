# AWS API client for AWS Outposts

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure,
APIs, and tools to customer premises. By providing local access to AWS
managed infrastructure, AWS Outposts enables customers to build and run
applications on premises using the same programming interfaces as in AWS
Regions, while using local compute and storage resources for lower latency
and local data processing needs.
