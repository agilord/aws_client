# AWS API client for AWS Outposts

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Web Services Outposts is a fully managed service that extends Amazon
Web Services infrastructure, APIs, and tools to customer premises. By
providing local access to Amazon Web Services managed infrastructure, Amazon
Web Services Outposts enables customers to build and run applications on
premises using the same programming interfaces as in Amazon Web Services
Regions, while using local compute and storage resources for lower latency
and local data processing needs.
