# AWS API client for Elastic Load Balancing

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances.
This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load
balancer also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures
that it routes traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load
balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners,
which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number for connections
from the load balancer to the instances.
