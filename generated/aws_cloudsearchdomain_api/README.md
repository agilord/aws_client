# AWS API client for Amazon CloudSearch Domain

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
You use the AmazonCloudSearch2013 API to upload documents to a search domain
and search those documents.

The endpoints for submitting <code>UploadDocuments</code>,
<code>Search</code>, and <code>Suggest</code> requests are domain-specific.
To get the endpoints for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch
configuration service <code>DescribeDomains</code> action. The domain
endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon
CloudSearch console. You submit suggest requests to the search endpoint.

CloudSearch Developer Guide</a>.
