# AWS API client for AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
This is the <i>ACM Private CA API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions,
syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved
in creating and managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your
organization.

The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and
the XML response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access
an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're
using. For more information, see <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.
<note>
Each ACM Private CA API action has a throttling limit which determines the
number of times the action can be called per second. For more information,
see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaLimits.html#PcaLimits-api">API
Rate Limits in ACM Private CA</a> in the ACM Private CA user guide.
