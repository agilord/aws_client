*About the service:*
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely
controlling access to AWS services. With IAM, you can centrally manage
users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that
control which AWS resources users and applications can access. For more
information about IAM, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity
and Access Management (IAM)</a> and the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">AWS Identity and
Access Management User Guide</a>.
