# AWS API client for AWS Identity and Access Management

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely
controlling access to Amazon Web Services services. With IAM, you can
centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and
permissions that control which Amazon Web Services resources users and
applications can access. For more information about IAM, see <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>
and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Identity
and Access Management User Guide</a>.
