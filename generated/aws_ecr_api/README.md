# AWS API client for Amazon EC2 Container Registry

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image
registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their
preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a
secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container
Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with
resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2
instances can access repositories and images.
