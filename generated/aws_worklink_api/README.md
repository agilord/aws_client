# AWS API client for Amazon WorkLink

**Warning: This is a generated library, some operations may not work.**

*About the service:*
Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access to
internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single
step, your users, such as employees, can access internal websites as
efficiently as they access any other public website. They enter a URL in
their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email.
Amazon WorkLink authenticates the user's access and securely renders
authorized internal web content in a secure rendering service in the AWS
cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content on
mobile devices.
