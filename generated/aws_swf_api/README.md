# AWS API client for Amazon Simple Workflow Service

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed
components. In Amazon SWF, a <i>task</i> represents a logical unit of work
that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a
workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and
concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.
